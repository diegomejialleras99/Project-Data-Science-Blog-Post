# Regression Analysis with World Bank DataÂ¶
The objective of this exercise is to fit a basic model to evaluate the relationship between various economic indicators and average life expectancy by country in a specific year. The explanatory variables are GDP per capita, the percentage of health expenditure, access to drinking water, access to sanitation services, and the literacy rate. Although many other relevant explanatory variables exist, these were chosen because they are recognized in the literature. The variable to be explained is life expectancy.

This project follows the CRISP-DM process and includes:

- Exploratory analysis and detailed visualizations
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Model training
- Model evaluation with metrics and SHAP values
- Prediction for Colombia in 2018

# File Descriptions

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above objective.
There is an additional .csv files with the data neccesary to train the final model to predict life expectancy.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here
