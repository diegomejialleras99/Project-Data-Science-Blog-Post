The objective of this exercise is to fit a basic model to evaluate the relationship between various economic indicators and average life expectancy by country in a specific year. The explanatory variables are GDP per capita, the percentage of health expenditure, access to drinking water, access to sanitation services, and the literacy rate. Although many other relevant explanatory variables exist, these were chosen because they are recognized in the literature. The variable to be explained is life expectancy.
